## Technical Details

### Quantum Resistance

QuantCoin employs post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions and wallet addresses. This makes the blockchain resistant to potential attacks from quantum computers. The implementation uses:

- Lattice-based cryptography for key generation
- Hash-based signatures for transaction signing
- Post-quantum secure key encapsulation mechanisms

### Proof of Stake (PoS) Implementation

The PoS consensus mechanism in QuantCoin:
- Requires validators to stake QTC tokens
- Uses a deterministic validator selection process
- Implements slashing conditions for malicious behavior
- Provides staking rewards based on participation and stake amount

### Distributed Computing

QuantCoin integrates a distributed computing platform that allows:
- Users to submit computational tasks to the network
- Validators to process tasks and earn additional rewards
- Verification of task completion through consensus
- Fair distribution of computing resources

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints run on HTTP for development. In production, ensure HTTPS is configured.
- Protect private keys and never share them.
- Monitor staking activities and rewards for any anomalies.
- Regularly check for software updates and security patches.
